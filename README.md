# hello-world
New to coding and all the help will be needed! :)
Im very interested in this coding and I would like to further my knowledge on this very interesting subject.
I didnt commit to college, not knowing what to even study and even if I chose a profession that i was sure about. 
There could be a chance I dont even get the job I went to school for. Now the ride begins and hoping for a great outcome.
